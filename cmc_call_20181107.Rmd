## Program Updates

### Bloomwatch

### cyanoScope

### other Bidness
*	Discussion start on rethinking our approach to the CMC. 
    -	BloomWatch is fairly stagnant, despite the fact that we have about 28 states signed on to the APP. This means the states have signed on, but have not promoted the product. Needs a lot of work, probably from the marketing standpoint. It appears a lot of the NE states are still asking for call ins to report HABs, or their own version of a paper form. Needs exploring…
    -	Cyanoscope seems to be ticking along. Had hoped for more participation, especially with the cyanoblitz call. 
    -	Is the website doing what we want? I see upticks on visits every time a listserv notice goes out, but not much else unless there has been a training. 
    -	The website should have a section for “Cyano Solutions.” We had talked about possibly hitching up with NALMS cyano group (comprised of Angela and Shane) and either linking to the NALMS site for management solutions for HABs or developing another section within our website. Would be good discussion to have during this call with Shane, as NALMS is coming right up.
    -	FYI-after reviewing each of the new England state environmental cyano webpages, I found the Cyanobacteria Monitoring Collaborative or Cyanos.org was only listed on two of the six state websites, Rhode Island and Maine. No mention of the bloomWatch APP anywhere on any pages despite all NE states joining the Bloomwatch App; many still operating on paper reporting forms or call ins. Pretty depressing considering the effort we have spent. 
*	Shane to finish his flow chart graphic? Discussion?
*	I have attached above a very sketchy outline of components we may want to consider for a  New England CMC Report. I would like to flesh this out and have everyone comment, add things I missed, strike out irrelevant stuff, brainstorm etc. so that we can present this at our cyano meeting in late November or early December. Let me know what you think!
*	Should we start thinking about a collaborative specific project for next year aside from the ongoing efforts? Would this foster more engagement? 
*	We should have some blog posts from members of the collaborative, i.e. watershed/lake associations, AED/UNH research, etc. We definitely get many more webpage visits when a blog is posted.
* discuss exploring ways for people visiting cyanos.org to connect with one another; maybe via a comment thread or something in order to begin conversations on cyano issues…just a thought!
